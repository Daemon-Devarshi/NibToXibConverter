Simple application to convert nib to xib.

It uses ibtool and helps to convert nibs to xibs in bulk by giving option to select input and output folder.

Here is a how to guide: http://daemonconstruction.blogspot.in/2012/10/nib-to-xib-conversion.html

Have fun :-)

Please note that the project is no longer actively maintained. My assumption is that this was useful when Apple first introduced XIBs, after that they moved to using Storyboard, Swift UI. So I think the initial use case is now obsolete. However if anyone still wants to use it for his/ her project I can provide commercial support for which I can be reached at ios.devarshi@gmail.com
